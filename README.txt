Rasputin
---------------------------------------------

(Random Alphanumeric Sequence Producer, Understandably Typical In Nature)

Rasputin generates random character sequences that can contain letters
of the English alphabet, integers from and including 0 to 9, and some
special characters. A very common use of this would be random password
generation.

Although naming it 'Yet Another Random Sequence Generator' would be
considered a clich√©, Rasputin actually is yet another random sequences
generator, just with a slightly different name.



Features
---------------------------------------------

There are 2 main features:

    - Character type selection,
    - Sequence length.

The character type selection currently provides 4 options:

    - Lowercase alphabetical,
    - Uppercase alphabetical,
    - Numerical,
    - Special characters.

Selecting any of these types means that the resulting sequence will
include that type of characters. If multiple types are selected, that
means each character can be from either of the selected types.

For example, if only 'lowercase' is selected, each character of the
resulting sequence can be a lowercase letter. And if both 'lowercase'
and 'numeric' are selected, each character of the resulting sequence
can be a lowercase letter or a digit between and including 0 and 9.

The sequence length can currently be an integer between and including
1 and 512.

Keyboard shortcuts are also provided for selecting sequence types and
generating sequences. The letters 'l', 'u', 'n', 's', and 'g' are used
for relevant actions.
